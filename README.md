# Deploy a Smart Contract

In this project, I have SUCCESSFULLY deployed a smart contract on ropsten test network.

I have used `remix` code editor of ethereum to extract the abi and bytecode of the smart contract.

NOTE: The object part (the hexadecimal part) of the Bytecode object (given by remix) is the actual bytecode of the contract.
