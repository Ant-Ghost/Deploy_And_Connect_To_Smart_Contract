# Deploy a Smart Contract

In this project, I have SUCCESSFULLY deployed a smart contract on ropsten test network.

I have used `remix` code editor of ethereum to extract the abi and bytecode of the smart contract.

NOTE: The object part (the hexadecimal part) of the Bytecode object (given by `remix`) is the actual bytecode of the contract.

---- _UPDATE_ ---

Initial code is shifted to _initial_practice_ folder.

In `main.html`, if you have the contract address, then put the address in `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable.

I have stored the contract object in `CONTRACT`.

Create custom functions to interact with your contract.
